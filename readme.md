# c2Mario

Very simple 2D platform game, similar to mario, written in c++ and SFML library. 
The goal of the game is to pass a map, and collect the key. If you fall from platform, you'll end the game.
I and TheMrDraven (https://github.com/TheMrDraven) wrote this project for c++ classes in Kielce University of Technology.
